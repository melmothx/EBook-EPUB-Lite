=head1 NAME

EBook::EPUB::Lite::NCX

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Class that "Navigation Center eXtended" file of OPF document

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Navigation Control file for XML applications (NCX) exposes the hierarchical
structure of a Publication to allow the user to navigate through it. The NCX is
similar to a table of contents in that it enables the reader to jump directly
to any of the major structural elements of the document, i.e. part, chapter, or
section, but it will often contain more elements of the document than the
publisher chooses to include in the original print table of contents. It can be
visualized as a collapsible tree familiar to PC users.
